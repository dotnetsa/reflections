1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It only shows the changes made in the new version, this makes seeing the bug easier.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
There could be code in the old versions that was deleted (didn't need that code), that you need now. 

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: More flexable. Commit logical changes.
Cons: Forget to commit.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Google Docs commits automatically, so only one file would have changed for each commit.

5.  How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
With git log you can get all the commited versions of files and with git diff you can view the changes between two versions

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can always revert back to the working version

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Development Code
